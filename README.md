# SHA256CNF
Implementation of SHA256 algorithm as boolean formula in conjunctive normal form and also implementation of SHA256 algorithm as binary string manipulation. 
Developed on computer with little-endian byteorder (sys.byteorder == 'little'), have never been run nor tested on machine with big-endian byteorder. 
This implementation focus more on readability and understandability rather than efficiency, therefore the implementation might not be efficient. 
example.py contain example on how to use the SHA256 implementation to generate hash. 
ConjunctiveNormalForm.py contain implementation of data structure of boolean formula in conjunctive normal form.
SHA256Satisfiability.py contain SHA256 implementation as boolean formula in conjunctive normal form. 
SHA256Binary contain SHA256 implementation as binary string manipulation. 
If you found any bug or flaw in this implementation feel free to open github issues. 
 
This implementation is based on SHA256 python implementation at https://github.com/keanemind/Python-SHA-256.
